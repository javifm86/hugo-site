other = """
My name is **Javier Fern√°ndez**, and I hail from Madrid, Spain. From the moment I discovered the vast and intriguing world
of the internet and web pages, I knew that my calling lay in this field.

Self-taught, I began learning `HTML` and `CSS` while still in high school, and eventually went on to complete a higher
professional degree in **Computer Systems Administration**. However, my passion for programming drove me to continue
honing my skills independently, constantly pushing myself to improve and innovate.
"""

[about_bio]
other = """

As a **frontend developer**, my expertise lies primarily in **Javascript**. I have extensive experience with vanilla Javascript,
as well as with jQuery and more recently with popular frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, and **Angular**.

In addition to my Javascript skills, I have a deep understanding of **CSS** and am committed to designing responsive websites. I
 have also worked extensively with preprocessors like **Sass** and **PostCSS**, as well as with frameworks such as
 Bootstrap and Tailwind.

For version control, I rely on **Git**, and I am a proponent of the **Git flow methodology** when working on team projects.

While I don't consider myself a fullstack developer, I have developed using **NodeJS**.

I enjoy developing tasks for optimization and automation, using task managers, Webpack or npm scripts.

My goal as a web developer is to create solutions that are accessible, optimized, and high-performing, always keeping
the end-user experience in mind.
