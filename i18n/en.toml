My name is **Javier Fern√°ndez** and I am from Madrid, Spain. Since I discover Internet and the world
of web pages I realized that I wanted to dedicate myself to it, and I began to learn HTML and CSS self-taught before
finishing high school. I studied a higher professional degree in **Computer Systems Administration**, but
soon I started to improve and learn in the world of programming on my own.
"""

[about_bio]
other = """

My profession is a **frontend developer**, my strong area is Javascript. I have worked with vanilla Javascript,
formerly with jQuery library and recently with frameworks such as Vue or Angular. I know **CSS** and I care about
responsive design. I have worked with preprocessors such as Sass and PostCSS as well as with some
frameworks such as Bootstrap and TailwindCSS.

I use **Git** as control version and I like using Git flow methodology.

Regarding backend, I have worked with **PHP** and **NodeJS**, although not as deep as to consider me a fullstack developer.
I love to develop tasks for optimization and automation with task managers (Grunt / Gulp), Webpack or directly with
npm scripts in NodeJS.

Accessibility, optimization and performance are my main objectives when offering solutions in web development.
